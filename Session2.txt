
Window Object: It is the top most object and the outermost element of the object hierarchy.
               The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document.


Document Object: When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of 
                 the page. The document object represents the whole html document as a tree 
                 of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). It is the root element
                 that represents the html document.document object is property of window 
                 object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior.
window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.
